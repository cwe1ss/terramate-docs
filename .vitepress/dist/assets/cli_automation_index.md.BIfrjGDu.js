Be more productive and reliable. Provide a better Developer Experience by building on top of tools your team already knows.</p><p>✨ <strong>Run in any existing CI/CD</strong></p><p>Terramate helps you to achieve the best automation and collaboration experience when working with Terraform and OpenTofu in any CI/CD. This means you can reuse existing infrastructure, collaboration features, audit logs and security.</p><p>✨ <strong>Design your workflows without limitations</strong></p><p>Configure limitless workflows. Whether you prefer merge-and-apply or apply-and-merge; we got you covered.</p><p>✨ <strong>Integrate any existing tooling</strong></p><p>Integrate third-party toolings such as <em>Infracost</em>, <em>Trivy</em>, <em>terrascan</em>, <em>checkov</em>, <em>OPA</em>, <em>Kyverno</em>, <em>Sentinel</em> and others into your workflows. Terramate allows you to integrate and run any tool.</p><p>✨ <strong>Reduce execution time of existing pipelines</strong></p><p>Parallel runs and change detection allows orchestrating stacks containing changes only and running those in parallel.</p><p>✨ <strong>No extra budget needed</strong></p><p>Enable cost-effective automation for IaC by integrating with your existing CI/CD instead of paying for an additional and expensive platform.</p><p>✨ <strong>Maximum Security</strong></p><p>Using your existing CI/CD limits the number of privileged platforms in your organization. There&#39;s no need to provide an additional platform with access to your cloud accounts.</p><h2 id="guides" tabindex="-1">Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#guides" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Guides&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following sections provide examples explaining how to use Terramate in automation using popular platforms such as GitHub Actions.</p>',19),i=[r];function s(u,p,l,c,m,d){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const h=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,h as default};
