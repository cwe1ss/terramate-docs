It integrates nicely with your existing tooling, such as GitHub or Slack.</p><p>We currently support Terraform and OpenTofu but plan to add support for more technologies such as Kubernetes, Pulumi, Cloudformation, CDK and others in the future.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Automation and GitOps workflows in any CI/CD, including previews in Pull Requests</li><li>Monitor many repositories</li><li>Private runners - thanks to the fact that there are no separate runners!

The CLI runs on a developer&#39;s workstation or in any CI/CD, used to orchestrate and automate Terraform or OpenTofu. The CLI syncs data such as Terraform plans, deployment metrics, metadata such as GitHub users and much more. Based on this data the Terramate Cloud provides visibility insights, observability and enhanced collaboration which can be natively integrated with Pull Requests in e.g. GitHub or Gitlab.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Terramate CLI never syncs any sensitive values in plan files such as secrets. Sensitive values are removed on the client side before syncing them to the cloud. In fact, Terramate Cloud doesn&#39;t require access to any of your cloud accounts or infrastructure code.</p></div><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Terramate Data Flow" title="Terramate Data Flow"></p><h2 id="how-about-ci-cd" tabindex="-1">How about CI/CD <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-about-ci-cd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How about CI/CD&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Terramate Cloud is not a CI/CD platform! We believe teams don’t need to adopt yet another CI/CD vendor. Instead, we integrate seamlessly with any CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, BitBucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, etc.), allowing you to reuse compute, security, logs, etc. This comes with a few benefits :</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong> because Terramate Cloud doesn’t need access to any of your cloud environments</li><li><strong>Cost-effective</strong> because you are not paying for additional computing just to run your Terraform</li><li><strong>Excellent Developer Experience</strong> because they can stay in a GitHub native environment</li></ul><p>If you&#39;re new to Terramate, please spend some time browsing through the pages in this documentation in the same order they appear in the menu.
