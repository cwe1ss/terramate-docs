This approach often leads to a combination of dozens of tools that solve different problems in automation, collaboration, security, observability, etc. Following this approach requires dedicated product teams that glue all those tools into an often fragile platform that doesn&#39;t scale.</p><h2 id="the-purpose-built-ci-cd-approach-ðŸ¤‘" tabindex="-1">The &quot;Purpose Built CI/CD&quot; approach ðŸ¤‘ <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-purpose-built-ci-cd-approach-ðŸ¤‘" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The &quot;Purpose Built CI/CD&quot; approach ðŸ¤‘&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>This approach is often referred to as &quot;TACOS&quot;â€”Terraform Automation and Collaboration tools. These purpose-built CI/CD platforms come with a heavy price tag, are time-consuming to onboard and manage, and usually require refactoring your existing IaC architectures into specific patterns. Using a dedicated CI/CD platform also requires you to grant these platforms with broad access to your cloud accounts and state files that often contain sensitive information.</p><h2 id="the-terramate-approach-ðŸ’«" tabindex="-1">The &quot;Terramate&quot; approach ðŸ’« <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-terramate-approach-ðŸ’«" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The &quot;Terramate&quot; approach ðŸ’«&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>We designed Terramate because we believe organization such as yours spent too much time building in either building proprietary platforms or by buying purpose built CI/CD platforms.</p><ul><li>cheap</li><li>secure</li><li>allows you to stay in your native iac</li><li>scalable</li><li>multi repo</li><li>any command</li><li>none intrusive</li><li>fast, scalable</li><li>allows you to work native</li></ul><h2 id="terramate-vs" tabindex="-1">Terramate Vs <a class="header-anchor" href="#terramate-vs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Terramate Vs&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Terramate creates a new category.</p>',13),s=[i];function n(l,u,c,h,p,d){return t(),e("div",null,s)}const T=a(o,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,T as default};
