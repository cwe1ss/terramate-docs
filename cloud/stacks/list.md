# Stacks List

The top-level navigation `Stacks` will list all known stacks over multiple repositories.

Each listed stack includes the stack's name, path, and repository information, along with its status.

By default, the list of stacks is sorted by the time of their last update, but you can choose other sorting options.

Filters allow you to select stacks from specific repositories or those with a particular status.

You can also search for stacks by including a search string in the name or path.

Selecting a Stack will open a [Stack Details](./details.md) page.
