# Account Linking

To utilize features like [Pull Requests Previews](../previews/index.md), [Deployment Insights](../deployments/index.md), [Drift Detection](../drift/index.md), and [Alerts](../alerts/index.md) in Terramate Cloud, you need to link your GitLab, GitHub, Microsoft, and Slack accounts.

For instance, to associate Pull Requests opened in GitHub with your Terramate Cloud account, you must establish an account mapping between your Terramate Cloud and GitHub user.

For that Terramate allows you to connect the following platforms to your Terramate Cloud account:

- **GitHub:** Links your GitHub to your Terramate Cloud User so that Pull Request Previews, Deployments, and detected
  Drift for repositories managed on GitHub can be associated with your Terramate Cloud User.
- **GitLab:** Links your GitLab to your Terramate Cloud User so that Pull Request Previews, Deployments, and detected
  Drift for repositories managed on GitHub can be associated with your Terramate Cloud User.
- **Slack (***coming soon***)**: Links your Slack to your Terramate Cloud so that the Slack Bot provided by the
  [Slack App integration](../integrations/slack.md) can send you direct messages about failed deployments or detected
  drift that is owned by you.

You can link your accounts in the [profile section](./index.md) of your Terramate Cloud account. We recommend linking all third-party platforms you use with Terramate Cloud.
