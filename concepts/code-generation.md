# Code Generation

Terramate allows you to generate code such as Terraform, OpenTofu, YAML or JSON.

Use cases:
- Keep your stacks DRY by generating backend and provider configuration for Terraform or OpenTofu stacks.
- Programmatically managing Terraform and Provider versions in stacks using `globals` allowing advanced techniques such as canary releases or partial updates.
- Generating GitHub Actions workflows.
