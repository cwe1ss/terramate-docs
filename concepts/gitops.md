# GitOps

This section explains **GitOps** as a core concept in Terramate.

## Introduction

GitOps is a recommended approach to managing infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code allowing teams to one or
multiple Git repositories as the single source of truth. It ensures that your infrastructure is always in sync with your
Git repository. GitOps enhances the observability and control of your system by pairing changes to Git commits.

## Use Cases

- Use one or multiple Git repositories as the single source of truth.
