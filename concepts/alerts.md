# Alerts

Alerts in Terramate help to manage special events that need attention such as failed deployment or detected drift. Terramate automatically creates an alert for those events and assigns individuals such as the author of a Pull Request or the CODEOWNER
of a stack.

In addition, alerts can send direct messages to groups or individuals in Slack using our Slack App.
