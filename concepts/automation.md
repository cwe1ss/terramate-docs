# Automation

Terramate integrates seamlessly with general-purpose CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD,
BitBucket Pipelines and Atlantis to automate your IaC lifecycle management using GitOps principles.

Compared to other tooling in the market, Terramate doesn't require you to manage any additional infrastructure and runs
without a backend.
