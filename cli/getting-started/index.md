# Quickstart

In this guide, you will learn how to get started with Terramate from scratch by building a basic Terramate
project that manages Terraform or OpenTofu in stacks using the most essential Terramate features, such as **stacks**,
**code generation**, **orchestration**, and **change detection**.

<!-- NOTE: Add more tutorials over time -->

<!-- If you want to get an overview of what Terramate CLI is and how it works, please read the [introduction guide](../../index.md). -->

## Introduction

For a quick example of how Terramate works, this guide takes you through the following steps:

1. Creating a new Terramate project.
1. Adding a couple of stacks using Terramate CLI.
1. Generating a Terraform Local Backend configuration in all stacks using code generation.
1. Orchestrating commands such as `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` using orchestration and change detection.
1. Syncing all stacks to Terramate Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started using Terramate, let‚Äôs run through a few quick steps to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

### Install Terramate

::: code-group
```sh [macOS]
$ brew install terramate
```

```sh [Linux]
$ brew install terramate
```

```sh [Windows]
$ choco install terramate
```
:::

Other installation options [are available](../installation.md#alternative-installation-methods). When the installation completes, you can test it out by reading the current version:

```sh
$ terramate version
```

### Install Terraform or OpenTofu

Next, Terraform or OpenTofu which we will orchestrate using Terramate:

- [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
- [Install OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)

## Create a new project

Terramate requires a git repository to work and every git repository is considered
a project in Terramate.

Let's set up your first Terramate project by creating a new directory `terramate-quickstart` and initializing a new, empty
repository:

```sh
$ git init -b main terramate-quickstart
$ cd terramate-quickstart
```

New git repositories are empty per default and don't contain any commits. The change detection in Terramate works by detecting
changes between at least two commits. Let's add an initial, empty commit to the repository:

```sh
$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial empty commit"
```

## Create a stack

Now that the repository is ready, you can create your first stack. We will give the stack an ***optional*** `name` and
`description` upon creation. Name and description can be used to keep track of the purpose and details of a stack.

Terramate will ensure that on creation, each stack gets an `id` set automatically if not defined by the user.

```sh
$ terramate create \
  --name "Alice" \
  --description "Alice's first stack" \
  stacks/alice
```

The `terramate create` command creates a file `stack.tm.hcl` containing a `stack {}` block to configure the stack, which will
look something like this.

```sh
$ cat stacks/alice/stack.tm.hcl

stack {
  name        = "Alice"
  description = "Alice's first stack"
  id          = "5b33e1c4-a3b0-477d-b0f1-add5918f764d"
}
```

::: info How does Terramate detect stacks?
Stacks in Terramate are identified by a directory that includes a `*.tm.hcl` file, which contains a `stack {}` block.
The file can have any name but the [terramate create](../cmdline/create.md) command always creates a file named `stack.tm.hcl`
:::

Next, let's check in our newly created stack to the repository:

```sh
$ git add stacks/alice/stack.tm.hcl
$ git commit -m "Create a first stack with Terramate"
```

To verify that Terramate is aware of the new stack, you can run [`terramate list`](../cmdline/list.md), which returns
a list of all stacks available in your project.

```sh
$ terramate list
stacks/alice
```

## Create a second stack

To create a second stack, we follow the same commands. First, we create the stack:

```sh
$ terramate create \
  --name "Bob" \
  --description "Bob's first stack" \
  stacks/bob
```

Next, we add the second stack to our repository:

```sh
$ git add stacks/bob/stack.tm.hcl
$ git commit -m "Create a second stack with Terramate"
```

To verify that Terramate is aware of both stacks, we can run [`terramate list`](../cmdline/list.md) again.

```sh
$ terramate list
stacks/alice
stacks/bob
```

## Change detection in action

Since we created our stacks step by step and created a git commit per stack, we can leverage Terramate‚Äôs
[Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) to see what changes we introduced in our latest commit.

```sh [shell]
$ terramate list --changed
stacks/second
```

By running the command mentioned above, you will see only the second stack is listed now, as we newly introduced the
second stack without changing the first stack. Terramate‚Äôs [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) is based on a
[Git Integration](../change-detection/integrations/git.md) but also supports more integrations like
[Terraform](../change-detection/integrations/terraform.md) to detect affected stacks using a local Terraform Module
that has been updated outside of the stack.

## Code generation

Empty stacks are of not much use. One of Terramate‚Äôs primary use cases is orchestrating Terraform and generating code for
it - but Terramate is not limited to Terraform and can also be used with other tooling such as OpenTofu, Terragrunt,
Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation, etc.

Every Terraform stack will need a backend configuration. For the sake of this Quickstart Guide, we will use the
Terraform local backend.

To generate backend code we create a file called `stacks/backend.tm.hcl`:

```sh
cat <<EOF >stacks/backend.tm.hcl
generate_hcl "backend.tf" {
  content {
    terraform {
      backend "local" {}
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

This configuration tells Terramate to generate a `backend.tf` file in every stack it can reach within the `stacks/` directory.
In this case our `first` and `second` stack.

To trigger the code generation we need to run the [`generate`](../cmdline/generate.md) command:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate generate
```

``` [output]
Code generation report

Successes:

- /stacks/first
  [+] backend.tf

- /stacks/second
  [+] backend.tf

Hint: '+', '~' and '-' mean the file was created, changed and deleted, respectively.
```
:::

The generation report will report any changes in the generated code. When run twice, no changes will be made.

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate generate
```

``` [output]
Nothing to do, generated code is up to date
```
:::

Let‚Äôs commit the changes and generated code:

```sh
git add stacks
git commit -m 'Add a Terraform Backend Config to all stacks'
```

::: tip
It's a recommended best practice to check in generated code to your repository.
For details, please see [code generation best practices](../code-generation/index.md#best-practices).
:::

## Run Terraform in both stacks

The stacks created in the previous sections both represent isolated Terraform environments. To make them functional,
we must run `terraform init` in both. This is where the Terramate Orchestration comes in handy, which allows us to
[run commands in stacks](../orchestration/run-commands-in-stacks.md) with the [run](../cmdline/run.md) command.
As mentioned before, Terramate is not limited to orchestrating Terraform but can run any command.

But before we can start, we need to prepare git to ignore terraform temporary files by adding a `.gitignore` file, which is
located in the root directory of our repository:

```sh
# NOTE:
# You might not want to add state and lock file here
# This is just convenient when running the quickstart guide
cat <<EOF >.gitignore
.terraform
.terraform.lock.hcl
terraform.tfstate
EOF

git add .gitignore
git commit -m 'Add .gitignore'
```

Now let‚Äôs initialize Terraform in all stacks:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run terraform init
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/first
terramate: Executing command "terraform init"

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

And run a Terraform plan:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run terraform plan
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/first
terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"

## Add Terraform resources

In this section, we create a Terraform [Null Resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource.html)
for the purpose of demonstration. Null Resources do not need to configure any cloud credentials as they do not create real
resources but only virtual ones.

This example will show:
- You can use plain Terraform config in any stack and do not need to use Terramate‚Äôs [Code Generation](../code-generation/index.md).
- Running only on changed stacks can save us time running and reviewing.

```sh
cat <<EOF >stacks/second/null.tf
resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {
}
EOF

git add stacks/second/null.tf
git commit -m "Add a null resource"
```

Applying the changes will need a sequence of re-initializing Terraform, and running `terraform apply` in the changed stacks.
As we only added the resource to the `second` stack, we can leverage Terramate‚Äôs [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md)
to run in the changed stack only too.

Running commands in stacks containing changes only, allows us to keep execution run times fast and blast radius small.

Re-initialize Terraform to download the null provider:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform init
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform init"

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/null...
- Installing hashicorp/null v3.2.2...
- Installed hashicorp/null v3.2.2 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Preview a plan:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform plan
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.quickstart will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```
:::

After reviewing the plan, we can apply the changes:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform apply -auto-approve
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform apply -auto-approve"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.quickstart will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
null_resource.quickstart: Creating...
null_resource.quickstart: Creation complete after 0s [id=6372471593458417750]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
:::

When running `terraform plan` again, we expect no changes to be planned anymore:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform plan
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"
null_resource.quickstart: Refreshing state... [id=6372471593458417750]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

We hope this tutorial has helped you grasp the basics of Terramate.
Here's a summary of what we learned:

- How to initialize a Terramate Repository with Git support
- How to create [Terramate Stacks](../stacks/index.md)
- How to leverage [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) when [managing stacks](../stacks/manage.md) or [running commands](../orchestration/run-commands-in-stacks.md)
- How to [generate code](../code-generation/index.md) (Terraform Backend) in all stacks to keep the configuration DRY
- How to deploy Terraform using a local backend and [null resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource.html) as an example
- Terramate is not limited to executing Terraform, but can help scale Terraform for any use case

Those examples hopefully give you a starting point and help you get insights into the capabilities of Terramate.
This is just the tip of the iceberg and running code generation and change detection on scale can help you save a lot of time when maintaining or running Terraform.
